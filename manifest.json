//"matches" defines the URL(s) to match to inject the code, docs : https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns.html
//"js" specifies all the .js files to be injected,
//"CSS" specifies all the CSS files to be injected.

//web_accessible_resources specify the path and format of files which the web page require to load from extension.
